# AWS Projects 

1)Python-based OCR solution to extract text from PDF contracts, enhancing text recognition accuracy
by 40% and enabling faster data extraction for contract analysis in a telecommunications R&D environment.


2)Automated data pipeline using Python, AWS Lambda, and Athena to extract key fields from large JSON
files reducing manual data processing time by 60% and improving data accessibility.


3)Designed and implemented a complete data pipeline on AWS to protect sensitive customer viewing data while still enabling useful business insights. The use case was tailored to a Dish Networkâ€“like environment where we needed to analyze regional viewing trends without exposing individual habits.
